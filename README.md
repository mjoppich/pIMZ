title: 'pIMZ: an integrative framework for imaging mass spectrometry analysis'
---

No idea what this framework does \...

\... it\'s not yet ready. But once it is, you will get to know a lot
more here!

This is a \"long description\" file for the package that you are
creating. If you submit your package to PyPi, this text will be
presented on the [public
page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python_package_boilerplate) of your
package.

Note: This README has to be written using [reStructured
Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), otherwise PyPi won\'t
format it properly.

Installation
============

The easiest way to install most Python packages is via `easy_install` or
`pip`:

    $ sudo pip install pIMZ
    $ sudo pip3 install pIMZ
