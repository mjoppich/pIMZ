pIMZ: python-based Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) data analysis
================================================================

pIMZ is a framework for Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) data analysis.
The python implementation is available from  `github.com/mjoppich/pIMZ  <http://github.com/mjoppich/pIMZ>`_.
For installation follow the instructions given in the GitHub repository.

pIMZ focuses on a differential setting, where masses, specific to certain areas are first determined, and then serve as input for a cell-type detection framework and/or a differential expression setting.
