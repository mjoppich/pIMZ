Welcome to pIMZ's documentation!
================================

pIMZ is a framework for python-based Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) data analysis.

pIMZ focuses on a differential setting, where masses, specific to certain areas are obtained, which then serve as input for a cell-type detection framework and/or a differential expression setting.
